Health monitoring is the major problem in todayâ€™s world. Due to lack of proper health monitoring, patient suffer from serious health issues. There are lots of IoT devices now days to monitor the health of patient over internet. Health experts are also taking advantage of these smart devices to keep an eye on their patients. With tons of new healthcare technology start-ups, IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry.

Items required:
Arduino Uno 
ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
LM35 temperature sensor
Pulse rate sensor
Push button
10k Resistor
